Technical:
perhaps condense the player variables into one stack (but clutter?)
maybe add more pointers?
convert copious for loops and array shenanigans into slices and slice tricks (https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SliceTricks)

Functional:
random map generator (separate program?)
random level selection
multiple movement/aggression profiles
saving maps/states/variables and whatnot

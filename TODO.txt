Technical:
convert all dir*[]'s to const(iota) values up top
perhaps condense the player variables into one stack (but clutter?)
maybe add more pointers?

Functional:
random map generator (separate program?)
random level selection
multiple movement/aggression profiles
saving maps/states/variables and whatnot
make a functioning inventory
